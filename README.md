# Pet Blog

## About

### Background

I have started this full-stack project to challenge myself to learn Object-Oriented Programming. I am using Typescript as the main language for this app.

Some of the things I want to consolidate:

* mutations
* creating end-points
* authentication and authorisation

Some ✨ new ✨ things I want to try out:

* object-oriented programming

### Methods used

* multiple React components
* database modules
* API client modules

## Installation - **From the command line**

```
git clone https://github.com/haruka-ogino/pet-blog.git
cd pet-blog
npm install # to install dependencies
npm run dev # to start the dev server
```

You can find the server running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and the client running on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
